==================

A Team Fortress 2 GUI designed to be a modern revival of the classics: M0reHUD and BroeselHUD, with a new and improved font: Futura.

This is the HUD that I personally use and, as such, it will most likely change, perhaps drastically, as time goes by. I love fiddling with huds. The great thing about GitHub is version control, it makes it easy to roll back to previous verisons. 

If there are any problems please open up an issue report on the GitHub issue tracker, or, if for whatever reason that's an issue, feel free to PM me here: teamfortress.tv/user/profile/hanbrolo
==================

For customization options: I'm not going to make many, perhaps a cross health if there's demand. I'd suggest doing any customization you want yourself, it's really not hard. 

Doodle's guide is a great resource: doodlesstuff.com/?tutorial=tf2hud

and

Flame's guide is a good introduction: https://code.google.com/p/flamehud/

Enjoy the hud!
